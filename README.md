# Happy Customers Project
- This is a project to learn ML predictions based on a relatively small dataset for practice only

## Steps to be performed:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Variable/feature engineering
- Machine learning prediction

# Data Description

- There are 7 variables split into dependent and independent variables. Those are:
-- Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
-- X1 = my order was delivered on time
-- X2 = contents of my order was as I expected
-- X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order
-- X4 = I paid a good price for my order 
-- X5 = I am satisfied with my courier
-- X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me 

- Attributes X1 to X6 indicate the responses for each question and have values from 1 to 5 where the smaller number indicates less and the higher number indicates more towards the answer. 

## Goal
- Predict if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to questions asked.

## Sucess Metrics
- Reach 73% accuracy score or above, or give a convincing solution on why another method is superior.

## Bonus
- They are very interested in finding which questions/features are more important when predicting a customerâ€™s happiness. Using a feature selection approach show them what is the minimal set of attributes/features that would preserve the most information about the problem while increasing predictability of the data they have. Is there any question that they can remove in their next survey?
